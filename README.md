# Minute - TaskApp

This repo contains the files of the todo App we build in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of the final project for the Junior Web Developer program.

# MINUTE

Is the result of a team effort between Sami and Phil!

## What is our App about?

This App was created with a design idea in mind, we wanted to bring a nice layout that engages users and help them organise their tasks into lists as well as create detailed task with a name, description, assigend to, status and due date, just in case they forget about their important chores.

The task are sortout in color that indentifies the status and help with knowing what has been done and whats still on the list. The users can also delete or add mor taks to de lists depending on the requirements.

## Let's get into the fun staff

- Just start by adding a list on the "My list" section.
- Then proceed to complete the form and add it to and specific list (it will let you know if you're missing something).

## What did we use to make it all happend?

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Github
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome Dev Tools
- Local storage
- Figma
- Trello
